# Python for Data Science
*Author: Satchit Chatterji (satchit.chatterji@gmail.com)*

Hey! This repository contains the teaching material for the course _Python for Data Science_ that I teach on behalf of [Turing Students Rotterdam](https://www.tstudents.nl) at Erasmus University, Rotterdam. The 2022 edition is currently running from the 31/10/2022 to 28/11/2022 and this repo is updated as it is taught. It is an introductory, hands-on, project-based lecture series on using Python for data science tasks. 

Feedback/suggestions may be made on the issues page or sent directly to me via email.

Please feel free to use this material as you wish!
